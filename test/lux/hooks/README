The code here serves to create a troublesome netsim device.  It is based on the
c-hooks example and is troublesome for two reasons:

1. There are transaction and set hooks that modify the configuration, so from
   the NSO perspective it appears as autoconfig.

2. The hooks also fail the transaction if the host name is longer than 4
   characters, but this is not obvious from the data model.

The netsim is used in the filtering.lux test case.
