# Usage: load-default-config.py netconf-device driver file-path
#
#  - device-name: device name; the device must be configured by DrNED/XMNR
#  - driver: device driver script to be executed to do the config reload
#  - timeout: operation execution time limit to perform the request
#
#  First, the CLI device driver in the form <name>.py is looked up:
#
#  * in the first file's directory
#  * its device/ subdirectory
#  * in the current directory
#  * in its device/ subdirectory
#
#  If one of the above succeeds, the driver is loaded. It then loads previously
#  stored default configuration file on a device using it's native CLI,
#  to return device to a default config state.
